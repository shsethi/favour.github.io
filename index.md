### Equating Value, Money and Wealth

We deem expensive things as valuable. Even though this statement is often true,  not everything valuable can be equated with Money. For instance,  just like an expensive car is valuable, so are your friends, parents, pets etc. While we can rationalise the value  of the car by money, we necessarily can’t do the same for relationships.  This brings an interesting question -  What is value and how is it related to money ?



### Value

Value denotes the degree of importance of some thing or action, with the aim of determining what actions are best to do or what way is best to live, or to describe the significance of different actions. In a simplistic economic sense, value is any good or service that you can buy. A sandwich has value. Someone coming to clean your house for money is providing value. But in a social sense, that's a bit insufficient — things have value that cannot be exchanged for money. The idea of value that economics is simplifying is really anything and everything that people need or want, which is just as impossible to pin down as it sounds. If I make myself a sandwich, I have provided value to myself. If I go for a walk in the sunshine, I am providing value to myself. If I bake a casserole and give it to my neighbour, I am creating value and providing it to her (and likely to myself as well in some unquantifiable ways). Value is all around us in ways that are very hard to define and pin down, and it can be created or destroyed simply by looking at it differently. And yet, this is the elemental material that all of the behaviours and forces that make up an economy are interacting with.


### Money
It is very common to think of value in terms of money. Economically, value is easiest to understand as something that can be bought and sold, and so that is the value that is generally studied, and nothing is bought and sold more frequently than money (whose primary value is that it can be bought and sold for pretty much anything). Money is the medium of exchange of value. 
If you go and do some work, and someone pays you $100, then in economic terms you have provided $100 worth of value and have been paid for it. Perhaps you could have gotten more elsewhere, but you did it because you like the job and are learning from it — in that case the job provided you some value, and so the net value you provide (the work's value minus the value the job provided back to you) was $100. Perhaps you were coerced into doing the work, even though it is worth $1000 — in that case, you provided $1000 of value in work, but someone else captured $900 of it, and you received $100.
That $100 is the medium of exchange (it's what you sold your work for, and it's what you use to buy other things of value like flour for your cookies), but it's also your store of value. It's your claim on future bags of flour that you'll need to buy.


### Wealth
If you think of yourself as someone who’s constantly creating and consuming value, your wealth is the delta over time. Again in economic terms, your wealth can be rationalised based on your assets like bank-balance, equity, real-estate  etc. However generally speaking we also consider a person with a  social capital as wealthy. The difference between economic wealth and wealth is economic wealth can be quantified and reasoned whereas other forms of wealth can’t. We don’t track how many times we create value in someone else’s life by cooking a meal, talking to someone in need, singing a song to cheer someone up and as a result we can’t really quantify our social capital.  And we don’t quite know how wealthy we really are. Both Nelson Mandela and Steve Jobs created a lot of value in our society. However we could approximate and reason about the value created by Steve Jobs but it would be really difficult to do that for someone like Nelson Mandela. 

## Opportunity

We all create value constantly. I create software for a company.
My parents cook food for me. On one hand the my company pays me - money and transaction is complete
But what my parents do for me is a - _favour_ - non-transactional.
In the current structure of the world we don't track a lot of non-transactional value.
I can walk away with that money. I can show people I am rich - indirectly prove my value.
My parents on other hand have only done me a favour which has no monetary value.
They may or may not be paid in return. At the end of life - My balance sheet will show $$$.
But nothing for my parents. Did they die rich or poor? Why the only way to store and show the value is money. Why not have a social account with social credits.


## Solution
With block chain we can keep audit logs of all the favours and services we have done for everyone throughout our lives. 
If we succeed in this, maybe the future fortune 500 list will have not just Jeff Bezos but also that old lady who has been feeding people all her life. ref
How it works
A does something for B.
A sends a req and B just has to acknowledge it.
A doesn't expect something in return. it's just a log of all the transactions.
